I am currently a student in Fullstack Academy's immersive web development course.

I am a digital historian, tool builder, and the creator of [SOTU-db](http://www.sotu-db.com), a web-based interface for performing sentiment analysis on the texts of US Presidents' "State of the Union" addresses. I was previously the Manager of the [Chicago Metro History Fair](http://www.chicagohistoryfair.org) at the [Chicago History Museum](http://www.chicagohistory.org) and a high school teacher in Chicago.
