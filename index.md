Hi, I'm Tyler! I am a values-driven software engineer and tool builder.

I was previously the Manager of the [_Chicago Metro History Fair_ (now _History Day_)](https://www.chicagohistory.org/education/historyday/) at the [Chicago History Museum](http://www.chicagohistory.org) and a high school teacher in Chicago.
