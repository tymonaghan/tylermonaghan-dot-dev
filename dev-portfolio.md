A digital archive of Lili Elbe's life narrative, "the first popular and well-documented narrative of genital transformation surgery," published under the title *Man Into Woman*. I had the opportunity to assist with textual encoding for this impressive project. I also contributed to the design of the website by authoring an HTML mockup and participating in the collaborative revision process.
